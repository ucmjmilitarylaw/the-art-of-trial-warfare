# Conclusion

Great trial lawyers are forged through conflict, not CLEs. In closing, Waddington reminds readers that discipline, practice, and post-trial reflection are essential. To become a legend in the courtroom, a lawyer must seek trials, learn from every fight, and always remain a student of strategy, not just substance.
