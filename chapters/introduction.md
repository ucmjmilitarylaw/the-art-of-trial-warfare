# Introduction

The life of a trial lawyer mirrors the battlefield: high stakes, relentless pressure, and no guarantees. In *The Art of Trial Warfare*, Michael Waddington introduces the "Trial Warrior"—a defense lawyer who draws inspiration from Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*. This chapter establishes the mindset required to win when the odds are stacked against you, especially in UCMJ trials, military sexual assault cases, and high-stakes criminal defense. Success isn't just about knowing the law—it's about psychological strategy, emotional control, and tactical aggression.
