# Waging War

In trial, speed and focus win over theatrics. This chapter emphasizes brevity, decisiveness, and psychological pressure. The jury is your battleground—win their attention, keep your message tight, and strike fast. In military justice, where prosecutors often delay and overwhelm, the Trial Warrior accelerates, targets weak points, and presents a streamlined narrative. Efficiency signals confidence. Rambling signals weakness.
